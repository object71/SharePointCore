# SharePointCore
Open source SharePoint REST API built on C# and .NET Core

# Tasks
I will start working my way trough the two typese of SharePoint user authentication. I found a good [blog post](https://blog.sprider.org/2016/09/15/access-sharepoint-online-rest-api-via-google-postman-with-user-context/) that demonstrates this and a [link](https://github.com/sprider/wordpress/tree/master/Samples/SPOL_REST_Test) to a C# example in github that I will port to .NET Core.

# Tests
I am still not sure how to test the library properly. Open to suggestions on my mail: capitane71@gmail.com
